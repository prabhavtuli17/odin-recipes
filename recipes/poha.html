    <p> <strong>Poha</strong>The word Poha (plural pohe) is used for two 
        things. One is the ingredient which is flattened rice and second 
        is this recipe or dish which I have shared here. Poha recipe is a 
        light breakfast dish. Basically pohe is made by mixing flattened rice 
        in a mix of seasoned spices and onions.It is ridiculously easy to make 
        poha recipe. To make it more nutritious you can add boiled peas, grated 
        carrots, roasted peanuts, cashews and garnish with coriander leaves 
        (cilantro leaves) and grated coconut.In Marathi language, the word “Kanda” 
        means onions. By now you know that the Maharashtrian word for flattened or 
        beaten rice is Poha. Hence the term Kanda Poha or Kanda Pohe.</p>
