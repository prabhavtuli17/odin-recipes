    <p> <strong>Upma  </strong>is a warm, homemade breakfast can be
    made relatively quickly, especially with this one easy tip. 
    In the step-by-step photo guide below, you will see the first 
    few steps of roasting the rava (cream of wheat).This can easily 
    be done ahead of time and I actually recommend roasting your 
    rava and keeping it in an air-tight container right after 
    purchase. This will help it stay good longer and prevent it 
    from becoming moldy or spoiled. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup finely chopped onions</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped green chillies and 1 teaspoon finely 
            chopped ginger</li>
        <li>8 to 10 curry leaves and 10 to 12 cashews</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chana dal (hulled and split bengal gram)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon urad dal (hulled and split black gram </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How To Make Upma</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Heat a pan or kadai first. Add 1 cup rava or cream of 
            wheat (fine variety).Begin to roast the rava.
            Stir often while roasting the rava.</li>
        <li>The rava or sooji grains should become fragrant and start 
            to look dry, separate and crisp. Don't brown the rava.</li>
        <li>Once the rava becomes fragrant and starts to look dry 
            and crisp, switch off the flame and put the roasted 
            rava on a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a pan, heat 2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter) or oil.
            You could use sunflower oil or peanut oil or safflower oil 
            or any neutral tasting oil. </li>
        <li>Lower the heat. Add 1 teaspoon mustard seeds. 
            When you hear the crackling sound of mustard seeds, 
            it means they are getting fried.</li>
        <li>Now add the ½ teaspoon cumin seeds along with 1 teaspoon 
            chana dal (husked and split bengal gram) and 1 teaspoon 
            urad dal (husked and split black gram).</li>
        <li>Stirring often fry until the chana dal and urad dal begin 
            to brown a bit.mmediately add 10 to 12 cashews and begin 
            to fry on a low to medium-low heat.By the time the cashews
            get golden the dals should also be golden.</li>
        <li>Now add the finely chopped onions. Sauté the onions until 
            they soften and become translucent on a low to medium-low
            heat.</li>
        <li>Then add the chopped green chillies, ginger and curry leaves. 
            You can also add 1 dried red chilli at this step.Mix well & 
            sauté for a few seconds.</li>
